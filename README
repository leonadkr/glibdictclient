This shared library implements a client part of DICT protocol referenced by RFC 2229, excluding extensions.

The library uses glib, also you need cmake to build it. If you set -DGLIBDICTCLIENT_UTIL=y, the utility program glib-dict-client will also be built. This program should be used only for testing the library.

To build:
cmake -S glib-dict-client -B /tmp/glib-dict-client/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=GlibToolChain.cmake

To install:
DESTDIR=$HOME/.local cmake --build /tmp/glib-dict-client/release --config Release --target install/strip

To use:
compile your program with:
gcc -o /path/to/your/binary -I$HOME/.local/usr/include -L$HOME/.local/usr/lib64 /path/to/your/source.c

then run your program:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/.local/usr/lib64" /path/to/your/binary

the same for the utility program:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/.local/usr/lib64" $HOME/.local/usr/bin/glib-dict-client

To generate documentation for the library, use glibdictclient.doxy file (or your own one) in directory src:
cd src && doxygen glibdictclient.doxy
